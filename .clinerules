# Project Guidelines

## General practices

- before updating local files, always read them first to make sure you have its updated version in your context
- avoid making any modifications that are not strictly necessary to the task you've been requested to do
- if you spot any possible errors or have suggestions for improvement outside of the scope of your requested task, you can add them to your Task Completed message
- always work within a virtual environment or conda environment

## Critical Thinking practices

- Always ask yourself: "are you sure this is the best way to implement this?"

## Security practices

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output

## Code Practices

- Always apply `black .` at the end of your tasks.
- Lists of items should always have a comma at the end of the last item

## Tools practices

- Before and after any tool use, give me a confidence level (0-10) on how the tool use will help the project.
